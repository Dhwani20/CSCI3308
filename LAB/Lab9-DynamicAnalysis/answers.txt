PART 1

1) make - returned successfully

2) ./pi - Segmentation Fault (core dumped)
	Illegal read and writes in a unallocated memory space

3) gdb pi 

4) Progam Crashes on line 89

5) Exit

6) PROBLEM IS UNALLOCATED MEMORY FOR pt
	corrected by allocating memory for pt = malloc(sizeof(*pt))

7)

8) Inferior 

9) b zeroDist

10)

11) print other_pt->x $1
    print other_pt->y $2

12) delete break 1
    clear zeroDist

PART 2

1) valgrind --leak-check=yes ./pi

2) The code is leaking 31,999,984 bytes of memory in 1,999,999 blocks
	    possibly 16 more bytes in 1 block

3)Problematic line numbers: zeroDist line 41
			    main     line 88

4) We need to free the pt and zero_pt memory allocation pointers

6) NO leaks possible

Part 3

1) 13,000,000 iterations causes 1.01 seconds 

2) running with 1000 iterations

3) Looking at kcachegrind.out.4294

4) TOP 5 FUNCTIONS:
main 		82.65
zeroDist	51.27
malloc		21.72
dist		20.80
pow		15.03
