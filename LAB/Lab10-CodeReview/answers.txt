Snippet 1
- variables aren't self explanatory
- only allows for one path
- path is hard coded

Snippet 2
- Lack of comments describing counters
- clarify the use of self.path in self.before
- still not enough comments describing the process
- some unused functions included - stop, change_interval
- questions in the comments
- self.path defined before use*

Snippet 3
- Defined location for watching of directories
- finish timing but never start*

3)
A)Line-21 Hard coding the path line will make this code unscalable on other computers unless the directory is included
B)Line-39 Don't start the time so, the average calculation will not work
C)Line-22 Needs new implementation when self.path isn't hardcoded

5) It would be more readable if a brief definition of the variables were provided and their use in the code.
